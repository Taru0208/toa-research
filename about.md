## Anticipation Theory (ToA)

Anticipation Theory is a mathematical framework for measuring engagement in game design, developed by Jeeheon (Lloyd) Oh at Farseer Co., Ltd.

The core idea: **fun is not subjective** — it emerges from the mathematical structure of uncertainty across nested decision layers.

### Key Metrics

- **A₁ (Local Anticipation):** Immediate excitement — the variance of possible outcomes from any given state.
- **A₂+ (Nested Anticipation):** Strategic depth — how current decisions affect the *range* of future possibilities.
- **GDS (Game Design Score):** A weighted composite that captures both immediate drama and long-term engagement.

### This Research

This site documents my exploration of the theory through:

- **Porting** the original C++ implementation to Python for easier experimentation
- **Reproducing** all 8 reference game models with verified results
- **Extending** with new experiments — genetic optimization, narrative structure analysis, MOBA modeling
- **Discovering** novel game mechanics that maximize GDS scores
